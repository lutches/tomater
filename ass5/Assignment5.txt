Nonterminals: S

    aSb     Sb

    aSbb    aSbb

There is ambiguity when doing the parse tree
since the expression asb and sb can be done in
any order to yield the same result

M = {a^ib^(i + j) | i, j ∈ ℕ}.
G = ({S}, {a,b}, S -> aSb | Sb | ε , S )
with the formula M we have two options, increase with i or j.
These options can be found i P aswell as the base case.
smallest case is i = 0 and j = 0, gives us ""
What we have to prove: for every w that belongs to L(G,S). w belongs to M.
We know that
1: S -> ε belong to P therefore "" eblongs to L(G,S).
2: S -> Sb belong to P therefore Sb belong to L(G,S).
3: S -> aSb belong to P therefore aSb belong to L(G,S).
4: because 2 AND 3 therefore aSbb blongs to L(G,aSb) AND aSbb belongs to L (G,Sb)
5: because 4 AND (2 AND 3) -> aSbb belongs to L(G,S)

Because 1 AND 5 we know that the grammar encompasses the entire language
