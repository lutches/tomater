To determine the equivilence of the two regular expressions we construct DFAs for each of them,
then we minimize one of the DFAs (the other is already minimal)

a*(b+ab*)

using subset construction
            a       b
-> {s0}     {s1,s2} {s1}
*  {s0,s2}  {s0,s2} {s1,s2}
*  {s1}     Ø       Ø
*  {s1,s2}  Ø       {s2}
    Ø       Ø       Ø
*   {s2} Ø {s2}

        a   b

*   B   B   D
*   C   E   E
*   D   E   F
    E   E   E

b + aa*b*
            a       b
-> {s0}     {s2,s4} {s1}

Which is equal to the other DFA

We can do proof by contradiction
Assume that the complement to the non-regular langugae L , ∑* \ L is regular, since all finite langugaes
are regular. However this contradicts the closure property of ∑* \ L being regular if L is regular and L ⊆ ∑*,
since we have previously established that L is not regular, a contradiction and thus the proof is complete

(3)

Assume we have w=0^n1^n2^{2n}. We know that y̸=ε and |xy|≤n. Since|xy|≤n and we know that xy appears before w,
we know that xy consists only of 0’s. The pumping lemma tells us that xz is in L, if L is regular.
This conclusion is the case when k = 0 in the pumping lemma. However since y ̸= ε, we know that |y| ≥ 1, 
so xz has at most n−1 0’s. This means that #0(xz)+#1(xz) ̸= #2(xz) since one 0 is missing, and thus xz is not in L.
We have proved that xz is not in L, so we have a proof by contradiction that L is not regular.
